### This is the simple multiple file sync application using UDP

---

> I made a protocol called VTP (Vamsi Transfer Protocol) which is used to transfer the files between the client and the server and syncing files b/w two or more clients.

---
The protocol looks like this
> filename size offset_start offset_end

---

### Example

* ```test.txt 65534 6 65540``` - This means that the file is test.txt, the size of the file is 65534 bytes, the offset
  start is 6 bytes and the offset end is 65540 bytes.

---

### Commands To Run The Application
* To run the server
```sh
 java -jar ./target/Server.jar 8080 ./storage
```
* To run the client
```sh
java -jar ./target/Client.jar 8000 ./client_storage server_ip:8080
```
> Replace the server_ip with the ip address of the server
