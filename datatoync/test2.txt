What is a Module?
JavaScript modules are a way to organize and structure code. They allow developers to break their code into smaller, reusable pieces. You can think about them as smaller pieces of code that you can import and export between different parts of an application.
Throughout this article, we'll go through how use modules in your program and the best ways to do it.
But first, let's talk about some more reasons to use modules.
The Benefits of Using Modules
Your code will still run if you put it all in the same file. But you might be causing some problems for yourself. Let's talk about some benefits of using modules in your program.
More Organized Cod
Using modules in your application makes everything well-sorted and arranged. It also makes your work easier to understand for anyone that wants to go through your code.
You probably wouldn't be excited to find a variable called "username" on line 431 or to need to start renaming a variable or function name everywhere it is used in an application.
Code Reusabilit
By breaking down your code into smaller, modular components, you can easily reuse those components in other parts of your application or in entirely new applications.
This can save you a lot of time and effort, as you don't have to rewrite the same code over and over again.
Also, if you make changes to a module, those changes will be reflected everywhere that module is used, making it easier to maintain and update your codebase.
